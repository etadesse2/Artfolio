Welcome to Artfolio. Here you can find instruction on how to run the app.
First, launch an emulator and drop the APK file inside the emulator. If you are new to the app, please navigate to the registration screen by clicking "Register" and login using the email and password you have created. Once successfully logged in, you can navigate the feed page, where you can find art uploaded by other artists. To view the art description, click on the artwork and you will be navigated to the art screen. If you would like, click the "Commissions" button to send a request or add a comment below. If you are looking for a specific type of art, use the filter on the feed screen. To go to your portfolio and profile, navigate using the navigation bar below and press the icon on the right. Here, you can find your information, upload a profile picture, reset your password, refresh, and logout. Additionally, you can find your portfolio by clicking the box that says "Portfolio" (swipe to exit). If you are interested in uploading artwork of your own, please press the plus sign button and fill out all fields to upload. Wait for confirmation of a successful upload and find it in both the feed and your portfolio. 
We hope you enjoy the app!
